# Maximum-Minimum-Z-Score-Normalization-in-Python-for-Machine-Learning
This script demonstrates the Maximum, Minimum and Z-Score Normalization for Machine Learning purposes.

Hey! Its me again! Read this README first because we are now going into more intricate situations in Machine Learning! 
This script was designed to view the results of various Machine Learning projects. Please install these packages before
collaborating on the script! 

Step1: Install these packages:
     
       pip3 install sklearn
       pip3 install preprocessing
       pip3 install pandas
       pip3 install StandardScaler
       pip3 install MinMaxScaler (if this one does not work for you, its probably installed already.)
       
Step2: That's all folks!        

Happy Coding!
